This project demonstrates how to build a Tic-Tac-Toe web application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
The game includes functionalities to handle user clicks, track game state, check for winning conditions, and optionally implement an AI opponent.
This creates an interactive and engaging experience where users can play against each other or against the computer, aiming to get three markers in a row to win the game.
